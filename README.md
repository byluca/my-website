# Gianluca Lascaro - Web Portfolio

Welcome to my online portfolio! üöÄ

This website is a showcase of my work, skills, and passions. It has been built using a modern approach, incorporating a Docker CI/CD pipeline to ensure a continuous, easy-to-manage, and scalable development and deployment flow. If you're curious to see how I apply my web development experience, you're in the right place!

## üíª About This Project

This project is my personal portfolio, designed to provide a clear and elegant overview of my work. Inside, you'll find:

- **An overview of my professional experiences** and the projects I‚Äôve worked on.
- **The technologies I use** in my daily work.
- **A contact section** to get in touch with me easily.

## üöÄ Why Docker CI/CD?

To maintain an agile and easily scalable workflow, I decided to integrate a Docker CI/CD pipeline. This way:

1. **Consistent development environment:** Every developer or collaborator can run the application locally in an environment identical to the production setup.
2. **Automated build and deployment process:** Every time a commit is made to the repository, the CI/CD system automatically builds and deploys the application.
3. **Scalability and simplified management:** Docker simplifies container management, while CI/CD ensures a smooth, uninterrupted workflow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Docker:** Containerization for efficient development, testing, and deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implemented with tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI to ensure the correct automatic workflow.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For the frontend, I use standard web technologies.
- **Node.js:** For handling the backend and APIs.
- **MongoDB:** For database management and data handling.
